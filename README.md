# RecimeChallenge

A Java-based Spring Boot application for managing trending recipes. This project uses Maven as the build tool, and it is compatible with **Java 21**.

## Features
- Retrieve trending recipes via a REST API.
- Filter recipes by difficulty level.
- Mock external services with **WireMock**.

## Endpoints

1. **Get Trending Recipes**  
   ```http
   GET http://localhost:8080/api/recipes/trending
   ```

   This endpoint retrieves the full list of trending recipes in JSON format.

2. **Get Trending Recipes by Difficulty**  
   ```http
   GET http://localhost:8080/api/recipes/trending/filter?difficulty={easy|medium|hard}
   ```

   This endpoint retrieves trending recipes filtered by difficulty.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Java 21** (Ensure you have Java 21 installed)
- **Maven** (To build and run the project)
- **Docker** (To build and run the project in a container)

### Installing and Running the Application Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/giovannicarlos77/recime_challenge.git
    cd recime-challenge
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3. Run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

### Problems with Lombok

If you encounter issues with **Lombok**, ensure that the Lombok plugin is installed in your IDE. If your IDE does not support Lombok natively, you may need to add the Lombok dependency and ensure itâ€™s correctly installed in your build system.

Install Lombok in your IDE by following the [Lombok Setup Guide](https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview).

### Running the Application with Docker

To run the application with Docker, you can use the Dockerfile which builds the Spring Boot project inside the container:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
    To build the Docker image, run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker build -t recime-challenge .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
    After building the image, run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8080:8080 recime-challenge
    ```

    This will start the application in a Docker container, and the REST API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Testing the API

You can test the endpoints using **Postman** or **cURL**.

- **Get all trending recipes**:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/recipes/trending
    ```

- **Get trending recipes by difficulty**:
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/recipes/trending/filter?difficulty=easy"
    ```

## Structure

The project follows the typical Spring Boot structure, with controllers, services, and configurations divided into separate packages:

- `controller`: Contains REST controllers for handling requests.
- `service`: Business logic and external service interaction.
- `model`: Domain objects like `TrendingRecipe`.
- `configuration`: Configuration files for WireMock and other services.
- `resources`: Static resources and `application.properties`.

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:
```bash
mvn test
```

The tests are located in `src/test/java`, with separate test classes for each service and controller.
